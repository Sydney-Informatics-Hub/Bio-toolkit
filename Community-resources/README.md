# Community resources 

The bioinformatics community is an open and supportive community. Here are some resources to help you engage and keep up to date with the latest developments in the field. This list will be expanded over time. A [more comprehensive list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z4r0hHHnCmMGgBz9Is4kUDAi7Be9iAMIi5zusBDoW1w/edit#heading=h.r79ij2jp5tli) has been compiled by COMBINE.
